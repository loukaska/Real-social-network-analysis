# Real-social-network-analysis
The analysis contains a coauthorship network of scientists working on network theory and experiment, 
as compiled by M. Newman in May 2006 ("M.E.J. Newman (2006): Finding community structure in networks 
using the eigenvectors of matrices, Preprint physics/0605087"). The network was compiled from the bibliographies of two 
review articles on networks, with a few additional references added by hand. The version given here contains all components 
of the network, for a total of 1589 scientists, and not just the largest component of 379 scientists previously published. 
The network is weighted, with weights assigned as described in M.E.J. Newman, Phys. Rev. E 64, 016132 (2001).
